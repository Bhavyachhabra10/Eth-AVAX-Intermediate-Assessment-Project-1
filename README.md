Project Title: To create a smart Contract.
Description:
This code is like a digital system for the transaction information. 
Firstly, I have used the pragma solidity ^0.8.0, this is the license identifier. After that I have used the Enum for the transaction mode and a struct to store customer's details. 
Then I have used the mapping variable here and mapped the customer's data. Then I have created a function and then used 3 conditions here. 
1st condition is that we use require statement that the amount should be more than 500, 
2nd condition is the we use the revert statement that the transaction mode should be offline and 
3rd one is the assert statement that the time limit should be more than 2. 
After that I have registered the customer's details like address and just compiled the code.
